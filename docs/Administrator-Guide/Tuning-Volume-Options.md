You can tune volume options, as needed, while the cluster is online and
available.

> **Note**

> It is recommended to set server.allow-insecure option to ON if

Tune volume options using the following command:

`# gluster volume set <VOLNAME> <OPT-NAME> <OPT-VALUE>`

For example, to specify the performance cache size for test-volume:

    # gluster volume set test-volume performance.cache-size 256MB
    Set volume successful

You can view the changed volume options using command:

`# gluster volume info`

The following table lists the Volume options along with its
description and default value:

| cluster.data-self-heal-algorithm              | Specifies the type of self-heal. If you set the option as "full", the entire file is copied from source to destinations. If the option is set to "diff" the file blocks that are not in sync are copied to destinations. Reset uses a heuristic model. If the file does not exist on one of the subvolumes, or a zero-byte file exists (created by entry self-heal) the entire content has to be copied anyway, so there is no benefit from using the "diff" algorithm. If the file size is about the same as page size, the entire file can be read and written with a few operations, which will be faster than "diff" which has to read checksums and then read and write. | reset                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | full/diff/reset                                                                       |

If OFF, this option impacts performance of entry or metadata operations as it will set dirty flag at the start and unset it at the end of ALL update fop. If ON and all the bricks are good, dirty flag will be set at the start only for file fops, For metadata and entry fops dirty flag will not be set at the start This does not impact performance for metadata operations and entry operation but has a very small window to miss marking entry as dirty in case it is required to be healed.                                                                                          | on                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | on/off                                                                                |

Larger values would help process responses faster, depending on available processing power.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 1-1024                                                                                |
| server.gid-timeout                            | The time period in seconds which controls when cached groups has to expire. This is the cache that contains the groups (GIDs) where a specified user (UID) belongs to. This option is used only when server.manage-gids is enabled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 0-4294967295 seconds                                                                  |
| server.manage-gids                            | Resolve groups on the server-side. By enabling this option, the groups (GIDs) a user (UID) belongs to gets resolved on the server, instead of using the groups that were send in the RPC Call by the client. This option makes it possible to apply permission checks for users that belong to bigger group lists than the protocol supports (approximately 93).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | off                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | on/off                                                                                |

| storage.reserve                               | To reserve storage space at the brick. This option accepts size in form of MB and also in form of percentage. If user has configured the storage.reserve option using size in MB earlier, and then wants to give the size in percentage, it can be done using the same option. Also, the newest set value is considered, if it was in MB before and then if it sent in percentage, the percentage value becomes new value and the older one is over-written                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 1 (1% of the brick size)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 0-100                                                                                 |
