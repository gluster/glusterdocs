Over the years the infrastructure and services consumed by the Gluster.org
community have grown organically. There have been instances of design and
planning but the growth has mostly been ad-hoc and need based.

Central to the plan of revitalizing the Gluster.org community is the ability to
provide well maintained infrastructure services with predictable uptimes and
resilience.  We're migrating the existing services into the Community Cage. The
implied objective is that the transition would open up ways and means of the
formation a loose coalition among Infrastructure Administrators who provide
expertise and guidance to the community projects within the OSAS team.

A small group of Gluster.org community members were asked to assess the current
utilization and propose a planned growth. The ad-hoc nature of the existing
infrastructure is an impediment to the development of a proposal based on
standardized methods of extrapolation. A part of the projection is based on a
combination of patterns and heuristics - problems which have been observed and
how mitigation strategies have enabled the community to continue to consume the
services available.

The guiding principle for the assessment has been the need to migrate services
to "Software-as-a-Service" models and providers wherever applicable and deemed
fit. To illustrate this specific directive - the documentation/docs aspect of
Gluster.org has been continuously migrating artifacts to readthedocs.org while
focusing on simple integration with the website. The website itself has been
put within the Gluster.org Github.com account to enable ease of maintenance and
sustainability.
