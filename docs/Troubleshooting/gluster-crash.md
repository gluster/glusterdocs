Debugging a Crash
=================

To find out why a Gluster process terminated abruptly, we need the following:

* A coredump of the process that crashed
* The exact version of Gluster that is running
* The Gluster log files
* the output of `gluster volume info`
* Steps to reproduce the crash if available
