# GlusterFS Documentation

GlusterFS is a scalable network filesystem
suitable for data-intensive tasks such as cloud storage and media streaming.
GlusterFS is free and open source software and can utilize common off-the-shelf
hardware. To learn more, [please see the Gluster project home page](http://www.gluster.org).

**Get Started: Quick Start/Installation Guide**

Since Gluster can be used in different ways and for different tasks, it would be difficult
to explain everything at once. We recommend that you follow the Quick Start Guide first. By
utilizing a number of virtual machines, you will create a functional test setup to learn the
basic concepts. You will then be much better equipped to read the more detailed
Install Guide.
