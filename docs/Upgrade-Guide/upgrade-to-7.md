## Upgrade procedure to Gluster 7, from Gluster 6.x, 5.x, 4.1.x, and 3.12.x

We recommend reading the [release notes for 7.0](../release-notes/7.0.md) to be
aware of the features and fixes provided with the release.

> **NOTE:** Upgrade procedure remains the same as with 4.1.x release

Refer, to the [Upgrading to 4.1](./upgrade-to-4.1.md) guide and follow
documented instructions, replacing 7 when you encounter 4.1 in the guide as the
version reference.

> **NOTE:** If you have ever enabled quota on your volumes then after the upgrade
is done, you will have to restart all the nodes in the cluster one by one so as to
fix the checksum values in the quota.cksum file under the `/var/lib/glusterd/vols/<volname>/ directory.`
The peers may go into  `Peer rejected` state while doing so but once all the nodes are rebooted
everything will be back to normal.

### Major issues

1. The following options are removed from the code base and require to be unset
before an upgrade from releases older than release 4.1.0,
- features.lock-heal
- features.grace-timeout

To check if these options are set use,

```console
# gluster volume info
```

and ensure that the above options are not part of the `Options Reconfigured:`
section in the output of all volumes in the cluster.

If these are set, then unset them using the following commands,

```console
# gluster volume reset <volname> <option>
```

**NOTE:** Failure to do the above may result in failure during online upgrades,
and the reset of these options to their defaults needs to be done **prior** to
upgrading the cluster.

### Deprecated translators and upgrade procedure for volumes using these features

[If you are upgrading from a release prior to release-6 be aware of deprecated xlators and functionality](https://docs.gluster.org/en/latest/Upgrade-Guide/upgrade_to_6/#deprecated-translators-and-upgrade-procedure-for-volumes-using-these-features).
