## Upgrade procedure to Gluster 5, from Gluster 4.1.x, 4.0.x, 3.12.x and 3.10.x

> **NOTE:** Upgrade procedure remains the same as with 4.1 release

Refer, to the [Upgrading to 4.1](./upgrade-to-4.1.md) guide and follow
documented instructions, replacing 5 when you encounter 4.1 in the guide as the
version reference.

### Major issues

1. The following options are removed from the code base and require to be unset
before an upgrade from releases older than release 4.1.0,
- features.lock-heal
- features.grace-timeout

To check if these options are set use,

```console
# gluster volume info
```

and ensure that the above options are not part of the `Options Reconfigured:`
section in the output of all volumes in the cluster.

If these are set, then unset them using the following commands,

```console
# gluster volume reset <volname> <option>
```

**NOTE:** Failure to do the above may result in failure during online upgrades,
and the reset of these options to their defaults needs to be done **prior** to
upgrading the cluster.
