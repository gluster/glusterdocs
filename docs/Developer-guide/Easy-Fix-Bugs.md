# Easy Fix Bugs
Fixing easy bugs is an excellent method to start contributing patches to
Gluster.

-   Bugs which are marked with EasyFix flag can be found from below
    Bugzilla query.
    -   [Bugzilla Query For EasyFix
        Bugs](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/buglist.cgi?bug_status=NEW&keywords=EasyFix&list_id=2626252&product=GlusterFS)
    -   [RSS-feed for EasyFix Gluster Bugs](http://goo.gl/OpQwlv)
-   To fix EasyFix bugs,
    -   When you pick an EasyFix you want to work on, assign it to
        yourself and move it to ASSIGNED
    -   Check
        [Bug report life cycle](../Contributors-Guide/Bug-report-Life-Cycle.md) and
        follow it.
    -   Check Developers page for details about development workflow,
        GlusterFS design documents etc.

Sometimes an *Easy Fix* bug has a patch attached. In those cases,
the *Patch* keyword has been added to the bug. These bugs can be
used by new contributors that would like to verify their workflow. [Bug
1099645](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1099645) is one example of those.

### Guidelines for new comers

-   While trying to write a patch, do not hesitate to ask questions.
-   If something in the documentation is unclear, we do need to know so
    that we can improve it.
-   There are no stupid questions, and it's more stupid to not ask
    questions that others can easily answer. Always assume that if you
    have a question, someone else would like to hear the answer too.

[Reach out](https://www.gluster.org/community/) to the developers
in \#gluster or \#gluster-dev on Freenode IRC, or on one of the mailing
lists, try to keep the discussions public so that anyone can learn from
it.
