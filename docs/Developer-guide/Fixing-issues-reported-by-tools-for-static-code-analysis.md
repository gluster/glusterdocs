### Coverity

GlusterFS is part of [Coverity's](https://scan.coverity.com/) scan
program.

-   To see Coverity issues you have to be a member of the GlusterFS
    project in Coverity scan website.
-   Here is the link to [Coverity scan
    website](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/987)
-   Go to above link and subscribe to GlusterFS project (as
    contributor). It will send a request to Admin for including you in
    the Project.
-   Once admins for the GlusterFS Coverity scan approve your request,
    you will be able to see the defects raised by Coverity.
-   [BZ 789278](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=789278)
    can be used as a umbrella bug for Coverity issues in master
    branch unless you are trying to fix a specific bug in Bugzilla.
-   When you decide to work on some issue, please assign it to your name
    in the same Coverity website. So that we don't step on each others
    work.
-   When marking a bug intentional in Coverity scan website, please put
    an explanation for the same. So that it will help others to
    understand the reasoning behind it.
