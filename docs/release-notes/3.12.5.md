# Release notes for Gluster 3.12.5

This is a bugfix release. The release notes for [3.12.0](3.12.0.md), [3.12.1](3.12.1.md),
[3.12.2](3.12.2.md), [3.12.3](3.12.3.md), [3.12.4](3.12.4.md), [3.12.5](3.12.5.md) contain a listing of all the new features that were added and bugs fixed in the GlusterFS 3.12 stable release.

## Major issues
1. Expanding a gluster volume that is sharded may cause file corruption
    - Sharded volumes are typically used for VM images, if such volumes are
  expanded or possibly contracted (i.e add/remove bricks and rebalance) there
  are reports of VM images getting corrupted.
    - The last known cause for corruption #1465123 is still pending, and not yet
    part of this release.
