# Release notes for Gluster 3.10.6

This is a bugfix release. The release notes for [3.10.0](3.10.0.md) ,
[3.10.1](3.10.1.md), [3.10.2](3.10.2.md), [3.10.3](3.10.3.md), [3.10.4](3.10.4.md) and [3.10.5](3.10.5.md)
contain a listing of all the new features that were added and
bugs fixed in the GlusterFS 3.10 stable release.

## Major changes, features and limitations addressed in this release
**No Major changes**

## Major issues
1. Expanding a gluster volume that is sharded may cause file corruption
- Sharded volumes are typically used for VM images, if such volumes are
expanded or possibly contracted (i.e add/remove bricks and rebalance)
there are reports of VM images getting corrupted.
- The last known cause for corruption [#1498081](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1498081)
is still pending, and not yet a part of this release.
2. Brick multiplexing is being tested and fixed aggressively but we still have a
   few crashes and memory leaks to fix.
