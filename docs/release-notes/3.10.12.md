## Major changes, features and limitations addressed in this release

This release contains a fix for a security vulerability in Gluster as follows,
- http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1088
- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-1088

Installing the updated packages and restarting gluster services, will update the
Gluster shared storage volume volfiles, that are more secure than the defaults
currently in place.

Further, for increased security, the Gluster shared storage volume can be TLS
enabled, and access to the same restricted using the `auth.ssl-allow` option.
See, this [guide](https://docs.gluster.org/en/v3/Administrator%20Guide/SSL/) for more details.

## Major issues

1. Brick multiplexing is being tested and fixed aggressively but we still have a
   few crashes and memory leaks to fix.
