This is a bugfix release. The release notes for [3.11.1](3.11.1.md),
[3.11.0](3.11.0.md), contains a listing of all the new features that
were added and bugs fixed, in the GlusterFS 3.11 stable release.

## Major changes, features and limitations addressed in this release

There are no major features or changes made in this release.

## Major issues

1. Expanding a gluster volume that is sharded may cause file corruption
    - Sharded volumes are typically used for VM images, if such volumes are
  expanded or possibly contracted (i.e add/remove bricks and rebalance) there
  are reports of VM images getting corrupted.
    - The last known cause for corruption (Bug #1465123) has a fix with this
  release. As further testing is still in progress, the issue is retained as
  a major issue.
    - Status of this bug can be tracked here, #1465123
