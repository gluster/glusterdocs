# Release notes for Gluster 3.12.0

This is a major Gluster release that includes, ability to mount sub-directories
using the Gluster native protocol (FUSE), further brick multiplexing
enhancements that help scale to larger brick counts per node, enhancements to
gluster get-state CLI enabling better understanding of various bricks and nodes
participation/roles in the cluster, ability to resolve GFID split-brain using
existing CLI, easier GFID to real path mapping thus enabling easier diagnostics
and correction for reported GFID issues (healing among other uses where GFID is
the only available source for identifying a file), and other changes and fixes.

The most notable features and changes are documented on this page. A full list
of bugs that have been addressed is included further below.

Further, as 3.11 release is a short term maintenance release, features included
in that release are available with 3.12 as well, and could be of interest to
users upgrading to 3.12 from older than 3.11 releases. The 3.11 [release notes](https://docs.gluster.org/en/latest/release-notes/)
captures the list of features that were introduced with 3.11.

## Major changes and features

### Ability to mount sub-directories using the Gluster FUSE protocol
**Notes for users:**

With this release, it is possible define sub-directories to be mounted by
specific clients and additional granularity in the form of clients to mount
only that portion of the volume for access.

Until recently, Gluster FUSE mounts enabled mounting the entire volume on the
client. This feature helps sharing a volume among the multiple consumers along
with enabling restricting access to the sub-directory of choice.

Option controlling sub-directory allow/deny rules can be set as follows:
```
# gluster volume set <volname> auth.allow "/subdir1(192.168.1.*),/(192.168.10.*),/subdir2(192.168.8.*)"
```

How to mount from the client:
```
# mount -t glusterfs <hostname>:/<volname>/<subdir> /<mount_point>
```
Or,
```
# mount -t glusterfs <hostname>:/<volname> -osubdir_mount=<subdir> /<mount_point>
```

**Limitations:**

- There are no throttling or QoS support for this feature. The feature will
just provide the namespace isolation for the different clients.

**Known Issues:**

- Once we cross more than 1000s of subdirs in 'auth.allow' option, the
performance of reconnect / authentication would be impacted.

### GFID to path conversion is enabled by default
**Notes for users:**

Prior to this feature, only when quota was enabled, did the on disk data have
pointers back from GFID to their respective filenames. As a result, if there
were a need to locate the path given a GFID, quota had to be enabled.

The change brought in by this feature, is to enable this on disk data to be
present, for all cases, than just quota. Further, enhancements here have been
to improve the manner of storing this information on disk as extended
attributes.

The internal on disk xattr that is now stored to reference the filename and
parent for a GFID is, `trusted.gfid2path.<xxhash>`

This feature is enabled by default with this release.

**Limitations:**

None

**Known Issues:**

None

### Various enhancements have been made to the output of get-state CLI command
**Notes for users:**

The command `#gluster get-state` has been enhanced to output more information
as below,
- Arbiter bricks are marked more clearly in a volume that has the feature
enabled
- Ability to get all volume options (both set and defaults) in the get-state
output
- Rebalance time estimates, for ongoing rebalance, is captured in the get-state
output
- If geo-replication is configured, then get-state now captures the session
details of the same

**Limitations:**

None

**Known Issues:**

None

### Provided an option to set a limit on number of bricks multiplexed in a processes
**Notes for users:**

This release includes a global option to be switched on only if brick
multiplexing is enabled for the cluster. The introduction of this option allows
the user to control the number of bricks that are multiplexed in a process on a
node. If the limit set by this option is insufficient for a single process,
more processes are spawned for the subsequent bricks.

Usage:
```
#gluster volume set all cluster.max-bricks-per-process <value>
```

### Provided an option to use localtime timestamps in log entries
**Limitations:**

Gluster defaults to UTC timestamps. glusterd, glusterfsd, and server-side
glusterfs daemons will use UTC until one of,
1. command line option is processed,
2. gluster config (/var/lib/glusterd/options) is loaded,
3. admin manually sets localtime-logging (cluster.localtime-logging, e.g.
`#gluster volume set all cluster.localtime-logging enable`).

There is no mount option to make the FUSE client enable localtime logging.

There is no option in gfapi to enable localtime logging.

### Enhanced the option to export statfs data for bricks sharing the same backend filesystem

**Notes for users:**
In the past 'storage/posix' xlator had an option called option
`export-statfs-size`, which, when set to 'no', exports zero as values for few
fields in `struct statvfs`. These are typically reflected in an output of `df`
command, from a user perspective.

When backend bricks are shared between multiple brick processes, the values
of these variables have been corrected to reflect
`field_value / number-of-bricks-at-node`. Thus enabling better usage reporting
and also enhancing the ability for file placement in the distribute translator
when used with the option `min-free-disk`.

### Provided a means to resolve GFID split-brain using the gluster CLI
**Notes for users:**

The existing CLI commands to heal files under split-brain did not handle cases
where there was a GFID mismatch between the files. With the provided enhancement
the same CLI commands can now address GFID split-brain situations based on the
choices provided.

The CLI options that are enhanced to help with this situation are,
```
volume heal <VOLNAME> split-brain {bigger-file <FILE> |
	latest-mtime <FILE> |
	source-brick <HOSTNAME:BRICKNAME> [<FILE>]}
```

**Limitations:**

None

**Known Issues:**

None

### Developer related: Added a 'site.h' for more vendor/company specific defaults
**Notes for developers:**

**NOTE**: Also relevant for users building from sources and needing different
defaults for some options

Most people consume Gluster in one of two ways:
* From packages provided by their OS/distribution vendor
* By building themselves from source

For the first group it doesn't matter whether configuration is done in a
configure script, via command-line options to that configure script, or in a
header file. All of these end up as edits to some file under the packager's
control, which is then run through their tools and process (e.g. rpmbuild) to
create the packages that users will install.

For the second group, convenience matters. Such users might not even have a
script wrapped around the configure process, and editing one line in a header
file is a lot easier than editing several in the configure script. This also
prevents a messy profusion of configure options, dozens of which might need to
be added to support a single such user's preferences. This comes back around as
greater simplicity for packagers as well. This patch defines site.h as the
header file for options and parameters that someone building the code for
themselves might want to tweak.

The project ships one version to reflect the developers' guess at the best
defaults for most users, and sophisticated users with unusual needs can
override many options at once just by maintaining their own version of that
file. Further guidelines for how to determine whether an option should go in
configure.ac or site.h are explained within site.h itself.

### Developer related: Added xxhash library to libglusterfs for required use
**Notes for developers:**

Function gf_xxh64_wrapper has been added as a wrapper into libglusterfs for
consumption by interested developers.

Reference to code can be found [here](https://github.com/gluster/glusterfs/blob/v3.12.0alpha1/libglusterfs/src/common-utils.h#L835)

### Developer related: glfs_ipc API in libgfapi is removed as a public interface
**Notes for users:**

glfs_ipc API was maintained as a public API in the GFAPI libraries. This has
been removed as a public interface, from this release onwards.

Any application, written directly to consume gfapi as a means of interfacing
with Gluster, using the mentioned API, would need to be modified to adapt to
this change.

**NOTE:** As of this release there are no known public consumers of this
API

## Major issues
1. Expanding a gluster volume that is sharded may cause file corruption
    - Sharded volumes are typically used for VM images, if such volumes are
  expanded or possibly contracted (i.e add/remove bricks and rebalance) there
  are reports of VM images getting corrupted.
    - The last known cause for corruption (Bug #1465123) has a fix with this
  release. As further testing is still in progress, the issue is retained as
  a major issue.
    - Status of this bug can be tracked here, #1465123
