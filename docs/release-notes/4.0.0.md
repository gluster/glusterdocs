## Announcements

1. As 3.13 was a short term maintenance release, features which have been
included in that release are available with 4.0.0 as well.These features may be of
interest to users upgrading to 4.0.0 from older than 3.13 releases. The 3.13
[release notes](http://docs.gluster.org/en/latest/release-notes/) captures the list of features that were introduced with 3.13.

**NOTE:** As 3.13 was a short term maintenance release, it will reach end of
life (EOL) with the release of 4.0.0. ([reference](https://www.gluster.org/release-schedule/))

2. Releases that receive maintenance updates post 4.0 release are, 3.10, 3.12,
4.0 ([reference](https://www.gluster.org/release-schedule/))

3. With this release, the CentOS storage SIG will not build server packages for
CentOS6. Server packages will be available for CentOS7 only. For ease of
migrations, client packages on CentOS6 will be published and maintained.

**NOTE**: This change was announced [here](http://lists.gluster.org/pipermail/gluster-users/2018-January/033212.html)

### Management

GlusterD2 (GD2) is new management daemon for Gluster-4.0. It is a complete
rewrite, with all new internal core frameworks, that make it more scalable,
easier to integrate with and has lower maintenance requirements.

A [quick start guide](https://github.com/gluster/glusterd2/blob/master/doc/quick-start-user-guide.md) is available to get started with GD2.

GD2 in Gluster-4.0 is a technical preview release. It is not recommended for
production use. For the current release glusterd is the preferred management
daemon. More information is available in the [Limitations](#limitations) section.

GD2 brings many new changes and improvements, that affect both users and developers.

#### Features
The most significant new features brought by GD2 are below.
##### Native REST APIs
GD2 exposes all of its management functionality via [ReST APIs](https://github.com/gluster/glusterd2/blob/master/doc/endpoints.md). The ReST APIs
accept and return data encoded in JSON. This enables external projects such as
[Heketi](https://github.com/heketi/heketi) to be better integrated with GD2.

##### CLI
GD2 provides a new CLI, `glustercli`, built on top of the ReST API. The CLI
retains much of the syntax of the old `gluster` command. In addition we have,
- Improved CLI help messages
- Auto completion for sub commands
- Improved CLI error messages on failure
- Framework to run `glustercli` from outside the Cluster.

In this release, the following CLI commands are available,
- Peer management
    - Peer Probe/Attach
    - Peer Detach
    - Peer Status
- Volume Management
    - Create/Start/Stop/Delete
    - Expand
    - Options Set/Get
- Bitrot
    - Enable/Disable
    - Configure
    - Status
- Geo-replication
    - Create/Start/Pause/Resume/Stop/Delete
    - Configure
    - Status

##### Configuration store
GD2 uses [etcd](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/) to store the Gluster pool configuration, which solves the
config synchronize issues reported against the Gluster management daemon.

GD2 embeds etcd, and automatically creates and manages an etcd cluster when
forming the trusted storage pool. If required, GD2 can also connect to an
already existing etcd cluster.

##### Transaction Framework
GD2 brings a newer more flexible distributed framework, to help it perform
actions across the storage pool. The transaction framework provides better
control for choosing peers for a Gluster operation and it also provides a
mechanism to roll back the changes when something goes bad.

##### Volume Options
GD2 intelligently fetches and builds the list of volume options by directly
reading `xlators` `*.so` files. It does required validations during volume set
without maintaining duplicate list of options. This avoids lot of issues which
can happen due to mismatch in the information between Glusterd and xlator
shared libraries.

Volume options listing is also improved, to clearly distinguish configured
options and default options. Work is still in progress to categorize these
options and tune the list for better understanding and ease of use.

##### Volfiles generation and management
GD2 has a newer and better structured way for developers to define volfile
structure. The new method reduces the effort required to extend graphs or add
new graphs.

Also, volfiles are generated in single peer and stored in `etcd` store. This is
very important for scalability since Volfiles are not stored in every node.

##### Security
GD2 supports TLS for ReST and internal communication, and authentication for
the ReST API.If enabled, ReST APIs are currently limited to CLI, or the users
who have access to the Token file present in `$GLUSTERD2_WORKDIR/auth` file.

##### Features integration - Self Heal
Self Heal feature integrated for the new Volumes created using Glusterd2.

##### Geo-replication

With GD2 integration Geo-replication setup becomes very easy. If Master and
Remote volume are available and running, Geo-replication can be setup with just
a single command.
```
glustercli geo-replication create <mastervol> <remotehost>::<remotevol>
```
Geo-replication status is improved, Status clearly distinguishes the multiple
session details in status output.

Order of status rows was not predictable in earlier releases. It was very
difficult to correlate the Geo-replication status with Bricks. With this
release, Master worker status rows will always match with Bricks list in
Volume info.

Status can be checked using,
```
glustercli geo-replication status
glustercli geo-replication status <mastervol> <remotehost>::<remotevol>
```
All the other commands are available as usual.

Limitations:

- On Remote nodes, Geo-replication is not yet creates the log directories. As
a workaround, create the required log directories in Remote Volume nodes.

##### Events APIs
Events API feature is integrated with GD2. Webhooks can be registered to listen
for GlusterFS events. Work is in progress for exposing an REST API to view all
the events happened in last 15 minutes.

#### Limitations
##### Backward compatibility
GD2 is not backwards compatible with the older GlusterD. Heterogeneous clusters
running both GD2 and GlusterD are not possible.

GD2 retains compatibility with Gluster-3.x clients. Old clients will still be
able to mount and use volumes exported using GD2.

##### Upgrade and migration
GD2 does not support upgrade from Gluster-3.x releases, in Gluster-4.0.
Gluster-4.0 will be shipping with both GD2 and the existing GlusterD. Users will
be able to upgrade to Gluster-4.0 while continuing to use GlusterD.

In Gluster-4.1, users will be able to migrate from GlusterD to GD2. Further,
upgrades from Gluster-4.1 running GD2 to higher Gluster versions would be
supported from release 4.1 onwards.

Post Gluster-4.1, GlusterD would be maintained for a couple of releases, post
which the only option to manage the cluster would be GD2.

##### Missing and partial commands
Not all commands from GlusterD, have been implemented for GD2. Some have been
only partially implemented. This means not all GlusterFS features are available
in GD2. We aim to bring most of the commands back in Gluster-4.1.

##### Recovery from full shutdown
With GD2, the process of recovery from a situation of a full cluster shutdown
requires reading the [document available](https://github.com/gluster/glusterd2/wiki/Recovery) as well as some expertise.

#### Known Issues
##### 2-node clusters
GD2 does not work well in 2-node clusters. Two main issues exist in this regard.
- Restarting GD2 fails in 2-node clusters [#352](https://github.com/gluster/glusterd2/issues/352)
- Detach fails in 2-node clusters [#332](https://github.com/gluster/glusterd2/issues/332)

So it is recommended right now to run GD2 only in clusters of 3 or larger.

##### Other issues
Other known issues are tracked on [github issues](https://github.com/gluster/glusterd2/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+) right now. Please file any
other issue you find on github issues.

### Monitoring

Till date, the absence of support for live monitoring on GlusterFS created
constrained user experience for both users and developers. [Statedump](https://docs.gluster.org/en/latest/Troubleshooting/statedump/) is
useful for debugging, but is heavy for live monitoring.

Further, the existence of `debug/io-stats` translator was not known to many and
`gluster volume profile` was not recommended as it impacted performance.

In this release, GlusterFS enables a lightweight method to access internal
information and avoids the performance penalty and complexities of previous
approaches.

#### 1. Metrics collection across every FOP in every xlator
**Notes for users:**
Now, Gluster now has in-built latency measures in the xlator abstraction, thus
enabling capture of metrics and usage patterns across workloads.

These measures are currently enabled by default.

**Limitations:**
This feature is auto-enabled and cannot be disabled.

#### 2. Monitoring support
**Notes for users:**
Currently, the only project which consumes metrics and provides basic
monitoring is [glustermetrics](https://github.com/amarts/glustermetrics), which provides a good idea on how to
utilize the metrics dumped from the processes.

Users can send SIGUSR2 signal to the process to dump the metrics, in
`/var/run/gluster/metrics/` directory.

**Limitations:**
Currently core gluster stack and memory management systems provide metrics. A
framework to generate more metrics is present for other translators and core
components. However, additional metrics are not added in this release.

### Performance
#### 1. EC: Make metadata [F]GETXATTR operations faster
**Notes for users:**
Disperse translator has made performance improvements to the [F]GETXATTR
operation. Workloads involving heavy use of extended attributes on files and
directories, will gain from the improvements made.

#### 2. Allow md-cache to serve nameless lookup from cache
**Notes for users:**
The md-cache translator is enhanced to cache nameless lookups (typically seen
with NFS workloads). This helps speed up overall operations on the volume
reducing the number of lookups done over the network. Typical workloads that
will benefit from this enhancement are,
- NFS based access
- Directory listing with FUSE, when ACLs are enabled

#### 3. md-cache: Allow runtime addition of xattrs to the list of xattrs that md-cache caches
**Notes for users:**
md-cache was enhanced to cache extended attributes of a file or directory, for
gluster specific attributes. This has now been enhanced to cache user provided
attributes (xattrs) as well.

To add specific xattrs to the cache list, use the following command:
```
# gluster volume set <volname> xattr-cache-list "<xattr-name>,<xattr-name>,..."
```
Existing options, such as "cache-samba-metadata" "cache-swift-metadata" continue
to function. The new option "xattr-cache-list" appends to the list generated by
the existing options.

**Limitations:**
Setting this option overwrites the previous value set for this option. The
append to the existing list of xattr is not supported with this release.

#### 4. Cache last stripe of an EC volume while write is going on
**Notes for users:**
Disperse translator now has the option to retain a write-through cache of the
last write stripe. This helps in improved small append sequential IO patterns
by reducing the need to read a partial stripe for appending operations.

To enable this use,
```
# gluster volume set <volname> disperse.stripe-cache <N>
```
Where, <N> is the number of stripes to cache.

#### 5. tie-breaker logic for blocking inodelks/entrylk in SHD
**Notes for users:**
Self-heal deamon locking has been enhanced to identify situations where an
selfheal deamon is actively working on an inode. This enables other selfheal
daemons to proceed with other entries in the queue, than waiting on a particular
entry, thus preventing starvation among selfheal threads.

#### 6. Independent eager-lock options for file and directory accesses
**Notes for users:**
A new option named 'disperse.other-eager-lock' has been added to make it
possible to have different settings for regular file accesses and accesses
to other types of files (like directories).

By default this option is enabled to ensure the same behavior as the previous
versions. If you have multiple clients creating, renaming or removing files
from the same directory, you can disable this option to improve the performance
for these users while still keeping best performance for file accesses.

#### 7. md-cache: Added an option to cache statfs data
**Notes for users:**
This can be controlled with option performance.md-cache-statfs
```
gluster volume set <volname> performance.md-cache-statfs <on|off>
```

#### 8. Improved disperse performance due to parallel xattrop updates
**Notes for users:**
Disperse translator has been optimized to perform xattrop update operation
in parallel on the bricks during self-heal to improve performance.

### Geo-replication
#### 1. Geo-replication: Improve gverify.sh logs
**Notes for users:**
gverify.sh is the script which runs during geo-rep session creation which
validates pre-requisites. The logs have been improved and locations are changed
as follows,
1. Slave mount log file is changed from `<logdir>/geo-replication-slaves/slave.log`
   to, `<logdir>/geo-replication/gverify-slavemnt.log`
2. Master mount log file is separated from the slave log file under,
   `<logdir>/geo-replication/gverify-mastermnt.log`

#### 2. Geo-rep: Cleanup stale (unusable) XSYNC changelogs.
**Notes for users:**
Stale xsync logs were not cleaned up, causing accumulation of these on the
system. This change cleans up the stale xsync logs, if geo-replication has to
restart from a faulty state.

### Standalone
#### 1. Ability to force permissions while creating files/directories on a volume
**Notes for users:**
Options have been added to the posix translator, to override default umask
values with which files and directories are created. This is particularly useful
when sharing content by applications based on GID. As the default mode bits
prevent such useful sharing, and supersede ACLs in this regard, these options
are provided to control this behavior.

Command usage is as follows:
```
# gluster volume set <volume name> storage.<option-name> <value>
```
The valid `<value>` ranges from 0000 to 0777

`<option-name>` are:
  - create-mask
  - create-directory-mask
  - force-create-mode
  - force-create-directory

Options "create-mask" and "create-directory-mask" are added to remove the
mode bits set on a file or directory when its created. Default value of these
options is 0777. Options "force-create-mode" and "force-create-directory" sets
the default permission for a file or directory irrespective of the clients
umask. Default value of these options is 0000.

#### 2. Replace MD5 usage to enable FIPS support
**Notes for users:**
Previously, if Gluster was run on a FIPS enabled system, it used to crash
because MD5 is not FIPS compliant and Gluster consumes MD5 checksum in
various places like self-heal and geo-replication. By replacing MD5 with a FIPS
complaint SHA256, Gluster no longer crashes on a FIPS enabled system.

However, in order for AFR self-heal to work correctly during rolling upgrade
to 4.0, we have tied this to a volume option called `fips-mode-rchecksum`.

`gluster volume set <VOLNAME> fips-mode-rchecksum on` has to be performed post
upgrade to change the defaults from MD5 to SHA256. Post this gluster processes
will run clean on a FIPS enabled system.

NOTE: Once glusterfs 3.x is EOL'ed, the usage of the option to control this
change will be removed.

**Limitations**
Snapshot feature in Gluster still uses md5 checksums, hence running in FIPS
compliant systems requires that the snapshot feature is not used.

#### 3. Dentry fop serializer xlator on brick stack
**Notes for users:**
This feature strengthens consistency of the file system, trading it for some
performance and is strongly suggested for workloads where consistency is
required.

In previous releases the meta-data about the files and directories shared across
the clients were not always consistent when the use-cases/workloads involved a
large number of renames, frequent creations and deletions. They do eventually
become consistent, but a large proportion of applications are not built to
handle eventual consistency.

This feature can be enabled as follows,
```
# gluster volume set <volname> features.sdfs enable
```

**Limitations:**
This feature is released as a technical preview, as performance implications are
not known completely.

#### 4. Add option to disable nftw() based deletes when purging the landfill directory
**Notes for users:**
The gluster brick processes use an optimized manner of deleting entire sub-trees
using the nftw call. With this release, an option is being added to toggle this
behavior in cases where this optimization is not desired.

This is not an exposed option, and needs to be controlled using the volume
graph. Adding the disable-landfill-purge option to the storage/posix translator
helps toggle this feature.

The default is always enabled, as in the older releases.

#### 5. Add option in POSIX to limit hardlinks per inode
**Notes for users:**
Added an option to POSIX that limits the number of hard links that can be
created against an inode (file). This helps when there needs to be a different
hardlink limit than what the local FS provides for the bricks.

The option to control this behavior is,
```
# gluster volume set <volname> storage.max-hardlinks <N>
```
Where, `<N>` is 0-0xFFFFFFFF. If the local file system that the brick is using
has a lower limit than this setting, that would be honored.

Default is set to 100, setting this to 0 turns it off and leaves it to the
local file system defaults. Setting it to 1 turns off hard links.

#### 6. Enhancements for directory listing in readdirp
**Notes for users:**
Prior to this release, rebalance performed a fix-layout on a directory before
healing its subdirectories. If there were a lot of subdirs, it could take a
while before all subdirs were created on the newly added bricks. This led to
some missed directory listings.

This is changed with this release to process children directories before the
parents, thereby changing the way rebalance acts (files within sub directories
are migrated first) and also resolving the directory listing issue.

#### 7. Rebalance skips migration of file if it detects writes from application
**Notes for users:**
Rebalance process skips migration of file if it detects writes from application.
To force migration even in the presence of writes from application to file,
"cluster.force-migration" has to be turned on, which is off by default.

The option to control this behavior is,
```
# gluster volume set <volname> cluster.force-migration <on/off>
```

**Limitations:**
It is suggested to run remove-brick with cluster.force-migration turned off.
This results in files which have writes from clients being skipped during
rebalance. It is suggested to copy these files manually to a Gluster mount post
remove brick commit is performed.

Rebalancing files with active write IO to them has a chance of data corruption.

### Developer related
#### 1. xlators should not provide init(), fini() and others directly, but have class_methods
**Notes for developers:**
This release brings in a new unified manner of defining xlator methods. Which
avoids certain unwanted side-effects of the older method (like having to have
certain symbols being defined always), and helps a cleaner single point
registration mechanism for all xlator methods.

The new method, needs just a single symbol in the translator code to be exposed,
which is named xlator_api.

The elements of this structure is defined [here](https://github.com/gluster/glusterfs/blob/release-4.0/libglusterfs/src/xlator.h#L1055) and an example usage of the
same can be seen [here](https://github.com/gluster/glusterfs/commit/5b4b25c697f93d3dfe352013a442f2ec73fd3b8b).

The older mechanism is still supported, but not preferred.

#### 2. Framework for distributed testing
**Notes for developers:**
A new framework for running the regression tests for Gluster is added. The
[README](https://github.com/gluster/glusterfs/blob/release-4.0/extras/distributed-testing/README) has details on how to use the same.

#### 3. New API for acquiring mandatory locks
**Notes for developers:**
The current API for byte-range locks glfs_posix_lock doesn't allow
applications to specify whether it is advisory or mandatory type lock. This
particular change is to introduce an extended byte-range lock API with an
additional argument for including the byte-range lock mode to be one among
advisory(default) or mandatory.

Refer to the [header](https://github.com/gluster/glusterfs/blob/release-4.0/api/src/glfs.h#L777) for details on how to use this API.

A sample test program can be found [here](https://github.com/gluster/glusterfs/blob/release-4.0/tests/basic/gfapi/mandatory-lock-optimal.c) that also helps in understanding the
usage of this API.

#### 4. New on-wire protocol (XDR) needed to support iattx and cleaner dictionary structure
**Notes for developers:**
With changes in the code to adapt to a newer iatt structure, and stricter data
format enforcement within dictionaries passed across the wire, and also as a
part of reducing technical debt around the RPC layer, this release introduces a
new RPC Gluster protocol version (4.0.0).

Typically this does not impact any development, other than to ensure that newer
RPCs that are added would need to be on the 4.0.0 version of the protocol and
dictionaries on the wire need to be better encoded.

The newer iatt structure can be viewed [here](https://github.com/gluster/glusterfs/blob/release-4.0/libglusterfs/src/iatt.h#L47).

An example of better encoding dictionary values for wire transfers can be seen
[here](https://github.com/gluster/glusterfs/blob/release-4.0/libglusterfs/src/dict.c#L2454).

[Here](https://github.com/gluster/glusterfs/blob/master/doc/developer-guide/rpc-for-glusterfs.new-versions.md) is some additional information on Gluster RPC programs for the inquisitive.

#### 5. The protocol xlators should prevent sending binary values in a dict over the networks
**Notes for developers:**
Dict data over the wire in Gluster was sent in binary. This has been changed
with this release, as the on-wire protocol wire is also new, to send XDR encoded
dict values across. In the future, any new dict type needs to also handle the
required XDR encoding of the same.

#### 6. Translator to handle 'global' options
**Notes for developers:**
GlusterFS process has around 50 command line arguments to itself. While many of
the options are initial settings, many others can change its value in volume
lifetime. Prior to this release there was no way to change a setting, other than
restarting the process for many of these options.

With the introduction of global option translator, it is now possible to handle
these options without restarts.

If contributing code that adds to the process options, strongly consider adding
the same to the global option translator. An example is provided [here](https://review.gluster.org/18316).
