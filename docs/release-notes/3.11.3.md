# Release notes for Gluster 3.11.3

This is a bugfix release. The release notes for [3.11.2](3.11.2.md), [3.11.1](3.11.1.md), and
[3.11.0](3.11.0.md) contain a listing of all the new features that were added
and bugs fixed, in the GlusterFS 3.11 stable release.

This is possibly the last bugfix release for 3.11, as 3.12 is expected to be
released around end of August, 2017, which will hence EOL the 3.11 release, as
it is a short term maintenence release (see [release status](https://www.gluster.org/community/release-schedule/)).

## Major changes, features and limitations addressed in this release

There are no major features or changes made in this release.

## Major issues

1. Expanding a gluster volume that is sharded may cause file corruption
    - Sharded volumes are typically used for VM images, if such volumes are
  expanded or possibly contracted (i.e add/remove bricks and rebalance) there
  are reports of VM images getting corrupted.
    - The last known cause for corruption (Bug #1465123) has a fix with the 3.11.2
  release. As further testing is still in progress, the issue is retained as
  a major issue.
    - Status of this bug can be tracked here, #1465123
